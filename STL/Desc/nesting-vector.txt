Nesting vector:

    > Vector of pair:
      vector<pair<int,int>> v = {{1,2},{3,1},{4,7}};
      for{
        v[i].first & v[i].second for printing
      }
      
    > Arrays of vectors
      vector<int> v[2];
      here v[0],v[1] and v[3] are vectors
      it is like 2d Arrays
      v[0].push_back(10) ....
      v[0][10] gives the 10th element of v[0] vector
      here rows are fixed and colms are diff

    > Vector of vector
      vector<vector<int>> v;
      no. of rows are also dynamic here
      its also a 2d Arrays
