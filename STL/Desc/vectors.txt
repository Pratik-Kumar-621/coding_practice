Vectors:
    > Vectors are continuous memory blocks
      Vectors are array with dynamic size

    > Syntax
      vector<data_type> var_name;
      Ex: vector<int> v;
      We can also initilize the size of vector
      Ex: vector<int> v(10);
      here the size of vector is 10 and initially values at every indices is 0
      v={0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
      vector<int> v(10,3);
      here v={3,3,3,...,3} // 10 times

    > Functions
      vector<int> v;
      v.size -> give the size of the vector
      v.capacity -> gives the capacity of vector. capacity of vector is always *2
      v.push_back(6) -> 6 is added at the end of vector
      v.pop_back() -> last element of vector is deleted
      v.clear() -> remove all elements of vector
      ***pop_back and clear decrease the size of vector but not the capacity***
      vector<int> v1 = v; -> vector can be copied

    > Time Complexity
      size() -> O(1)
      capacity() -> O(1)
      push_back() -> O(1)
      pop_back() -> O(1)
      clear() -> O(n)
      copy -> O(n)
