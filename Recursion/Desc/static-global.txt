static variable is called only once in function

fun(int n){
    static int x=0;
    if(x>0){
        x++;
        return fun(n-1)+x;

    }
}
this returns n^2 as the value of x becomes n and added n times

same happens if x is declared globally

*** Never use count as a variable name in global variable ***
