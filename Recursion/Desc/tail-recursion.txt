if the recursive call is at the last of the function then it it tail recursion

i.e funciton is not doing anything at the returning times

EX:
    fun(n){
        if(n>0){
            ......
            ......
            ......
            return fun(n-1)
        }
    }

    *** return f(n-1) + n is not a tail recursion as it is doing something at the returning time

tail recursion is easily converted into loop and it is prefered to use loop instead of tail recursion as
the space complexity of tail recursion is O(n) and of loop is o(1)
